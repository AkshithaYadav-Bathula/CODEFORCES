# Most Common Subsegment

## Problem

We define an integer to be the most common on a subsegment, if its number of occurrences on that subsegment is larger than the number of occurrences of any other integer in that subsegment.

A subsegment of an array is a consecutive segment of elements in the array.

### Input

- The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - First line: two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100)
  - Second line: `n` integers `a1, a2, ..., an` (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100)

### Output

- For each test case, output `YES` if there exists a subsegment where `k` is the most common element, otherwise print `NO`.
